	abstract = {Throughout Earth's history, drought has been a common crisis in terrestrial ecosystems; in human societies, it can cause famine, one of the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse. As the global hydrological cycle intensifies with global warming, deeper droughts and rewetting will alter, and possibly transform, ecosystems. Soil communities, however, seem more tolerant than plants or animals are to water stress—the main effects, in fact, on soil processes appear to be limited diffusion and the limited supply of resources to soil organisms. Thus, the rains that end a drought not only release soil microbes from stress but also create a resource pulse that fuels soil microbial activity. It remains unclear whether the effects of drought on soil processes result from drying or rewetting. It is also unclear whether the flush of activity on rewetting is driven by microbial growth or by the physical/chemical processes that mobilize organic matter. In this review, I discuss how soil water, and the lack of it, regulates microbial life and biogeochemical processes. I first focus on organismal-level responses and then consider how these influence whole-soil organic matter dynamics. A final focus is on how to incorporate these effects into Earth System models that can effectively capture dry–wet cycling.},

	abstract = {1 The effects of precipitation on litter quality and surface litter decomposition were evaluated across a natural rainfall gradient, ranging from 500 to 5500 mm mean annual precipitation, on the island of Hawai'i. 2 Litter of Metrosideros polymorpha from the driest (500 mm) and wettest (5500 mm) extremes of the gradient was decomposed at five sites along the precipitation gradient. Metrosideros polymorpha litter collected from all sites was also decomposed at a single common site (2500 mm), and M. polymorpha litter collected from each site was decomposed at the site of collection (in situ). 3 Initial litter quality varied significantly with precipitation at the site. Leaf mass per area (LMA) and phosphorus content decreased, while lignin and nitrogen content both increased, with increasing site precipitation. 4 Mass loss of all common litter types increased with increasing precipitation, as did in situ decomposition, which gave k-values ranging from 0.22 to 1.06. When decomposition at the same site was evaluated, litter from the driest site decomposed up to 2.5 times more rapidly than wet-site litter. 5 Decomposition at the common site showed an inverse correlation between inherent decomposability of litter (i.e. litter quality) and precipitation at the site from which litter originated, with k-values ranging from 0.71 for litter from the driest site to 0.28 for litter from the wettest site. Decomposability correlated strongly and inversely with initial lignin concentrations. 6 Proportional nutrient release from in situ litter was slower than mass loss, but nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization generally increased with increasing precipitation. 7 At the common site, there was an inverse relationship between rate of nutrient release and precipitation at the site where litter was collected. The systematic variation in litter decomposability due to changes in annual precipitation appears to buffer the direct effects of precipitation on carbon and nutrient turnover.},

            Tropical forests modify the conditions they depend on through feedbacks at different spatial scales. These feedbacks shape the hysteresis (history-dependence) of tropical forests, thus controlling their resilience to deforestation and response to climate change. Here, we determine the emergent hysteresis from local-scale tipping points and regional-scale forest-rainfall feedbacks across the tropics under the recent climate and a severe climate-change scenario. By integrating remote sensing, a global hydrological model, and detailed atmospheric moisture tracking simulations, we find that forest-rainfall feedback expands the geographic range of possible forest distributions, especially in the Amazon. The Amazon forest could partially recover from complete deforestation, but may lose that resilience later this century. The Congo forest currently lacks resilience, but is predicted to gain it under climate change, whereas forests in Australasia are resilient under both current and future climates. Our results show how tropical forests shape their own distributions and create the climatic conditions that enable them.},
